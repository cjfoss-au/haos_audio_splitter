# HAOS Audio Splitter
This Home Assistant addon (or app, as of HA release 2026.2) splits a stereo USB audio device into two mono output channels and exposes them to HA to be used by other addons.

## Disclosure
This was heavily assisted by Github Copilot. I'm not a developer and don't really know what I'm doing, so use at your own risk. I probably won't be updating or repairing this unless it breaks for me or I need too add features (eg extra channels) in the future.
